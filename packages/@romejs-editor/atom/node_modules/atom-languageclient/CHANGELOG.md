## v0.8.0

This update improves auto complete support in a number of ways;

- Resolve is now called only if the language server supports it #162
- CompletionItemKinds defined in v3 of the protocol are now mapped
- Allows customization of the conversion between LSP and autocomplete-plus suggestions via a hook #137
- New onDidInsertSuggestion override available when autocomplete request inserted #115
- Use `CompletionItem.textEdit` field for snippet content #165

Additional changes include;

- CancellationToken support for cancelling pending requests #160
- Automatic cancellation for incomplete resolve and autocomplete requests #160
- Improved debug logging (stderr in #158 as well and signal report on exit)
