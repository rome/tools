Provide integration support for adding Language Server Protocol servers to Atom.

## Background

[Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) is a JSON-RPC based mechanism whereby a client (IDE) may connect to an out-of-process server that can provide rich analysis, refactoring and interactive features for a given programming language.

## Implementation

This npm package can be used by Atom package authors wanting to integrate LSP-compatible language servers with Atom. It provides:

* Conversion routines between Atom and LSP types
* A FlowTyped wrapper around JSON-RPC for **v3** of the LSP protocol
* All necessary FlowTyped input and return structures for LSP, notifications etc.
* A number of adapters to translate communication between Atom/Atom-IDE and the LSP's capabilities
* Automatic wiring up of adapters based on the negotiated capabilities of the language server
* Helper functions for downloading additional non-npm dependencies

## Capabilities

The language server protocol consists of a number of capabilities. Some of these already have a counterpoint we can connect up to today while others do not.  The following table shows each capability in v2 and how it is exposed via Atom;

| Capability                      | Atom interface                |

## Developing packages

The underlying JSON-RPC communication is handled by the [vscode-jsonrpc npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-jsonrpc).

### Minimal example

A minimal implementation can be illustrated by the Omnisharp package here which has only npm-managed dependencies.  You simply provide the scope name, language name and server name as well as start your process and AutoLanguageClient takes care of interrogating your language server capabilities and wiring up the appropriate services within Atom to expose them.

```javascript
const {AutoLanguageClient} = require('atom-languageclient')

class CSharpLanguageClient extends AutoLanguageClient {
  getGrammarScopes () { return [ 'source.cs' ] }
  getLanguageName () { return 'C#' }
  getServerName () { return 'OmniSharp' }

  startServerProcess () {
    return super.spawnChildNode([ require.resolve('omnisharp-client/languageserver/server') ])
  }
}

module.exports = new CSharpLanguageClient()
```

You can get this code packaged up with the necessary package.json etc. from the [ide-csharp](https://github.com/atom/ide-csharp) provides C# support via [Omnisharp (node-omnisharp)](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-node-client) repo.

Note that you will also need to add various entries to the `providedServices` and `consumedServices` section of your package.json (for now).  You can [obtain these entries here](https://github.com/atom/ide-csharp/tree/master/package.json).

### Using other connection types

The default connection type is *stdio* however both *ipc* and *sockets* are also available.

#### IPC

To use ipc simply return *ipc* from getConnectionType(), e.g.

```javascript
class ExampleLanguageClient extends AutoLanguageClient {
  getGrammarScopes () { return [ 'source.js' ] }
  getLanguageName () { return 'JavaScript' }
  getServerName () { return 'JavaScript Language Server' }

  getConnectionType() { return 'ipc' }

  startServerProcess () {
    const startServer = require.resolve('@example/js-language-server')
    return super.spawnChildNode([startServer, '--node-ipc'], {
      stdio: [null, null, null, 'ipc']
    })
  }
}
```

#### Sockets

Sockets are a little more complex because you need to allocate a free socket. The [ide-php package](https://github.com/atom/ide-php/blob/master/lib/main.js) contains an example of this.

### Debugging

Atom-LanguageClient can log all sent and received messages nicely formatted to the Developer Tools Console within Atom. To do so simply enable it with `atom.config.set('core.debugLSP', true)`, e.g.


### Tips

Some more elaborate scenarios can be found in the [ide-java](https://github.com/atom/ide-java) package which includes:

* Downloading and unpacking non-npm dependencies (in this case a .tar.gz containing JAR files)
* Platform-specific start-up configuration
* Wiring up custom extensions to the protocol (language/status to Atom Status-Bar, language/actionableNotification to Atom Notifications)

### Available packages

Right now we have the following experimental Atom LSP packages in development. They are mostly usable but are missing some features that either the LSP server doesn't support or expose functionality that is as yet unmapped to Atom (TODO and TBD in the capabilities table above).

### Official packages

* [ide-csharp](https://github.com/atom/ide-csharp) provides C# support via [Omnisharp (node-omnisharp)](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-node-client)
* [ide-flowtype](https://github.com/flowtype/ide-flowtype) provides Flow support via [Flow Language Server](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-language-server)
* [ide-java](https://github.com/atom/ide-java) provides Java support via [Java Eclipse JDT](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls)
* [ide-php](https://github.com/atom/ide-php) provides PHP support via [FelixFBeckers PHP Language Server](https://github.com/felixfbecker/php-language-server)
* [ide-typescript](https://github.com/atom/ide-typescript) provides TypeScript and Javascript support via [SourceGraph Typescript Language Server](https://github.com/sourcegraph/javascript-typescript-langserver)
