 unknown:1 lint/js/doubleEquals FIXABLE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ✖ Use === instead of ==.

    foo == bar
    ^^^^^^^^^^

  ℹ == is only allowed when comparing against null.

  Suggested fix: Use ===

  + foo === bar

  ℹ This may be unsafe if you are relying on type coercion
