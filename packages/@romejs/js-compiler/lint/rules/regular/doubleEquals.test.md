 unknown:1 lint/doubleEquals FIXABLE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

	✖ Use === instead of ==

	  foo == bar
	  ^^^^^^^^^^

	ℹ == is only allowed when comparing against null

	Suggested fix: Use ===

	+ foo === bar

	ℹ This may be unsafe if you are relying on type coercion
