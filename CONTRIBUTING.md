# Contributing

We can use help in a bunch of areas and any help is appreciated. Our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues) serve as a place for any discussion, whether it's bug reports, questions, project direction etc. As the project grows this policy may change.

Our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rome) is open for help and more adhoc discussion. All activity on the Discord is still moderated and will be strictly enforced under the project's [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Getting started with developing Rome takes three commands. You will only need Node v14 or above.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rome/tools
cd tools
./rome --help
```

No dependency installation step is required as we check in our `node_modules` folder that contains only a copy of TypeScript and some definitions.

## Developing on Windows

Use a backslash (`\`) rather than a forward slash (`/`) when running commands.

For example, to run help:

```bash
.\rome --help
```
or you can directly use `rome` without any path referencing like below:

```bash
rome --help
```

### User files

If files specific to your local development environment should be ignored, please add these files to a global git ignore file rather than to a git ignore file within Rome.

You can find more information on this process [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/ignoring-files#configuring-ignored-files-for-all-repositories-on-your-computer).

## Website

The [Rome website](https://rome.tools/) is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). To start a development server you can run the following commands:

```bash
cd website
npm install
npm start
```

## Checks

When working on Rome you will want to run the tests and linter to validate your changes. You can do both of these with a single command:

```bash
./rome ci
```

This is the main command we run when you submit a PR, so running it locally and making sure it passes will make it easier to review and merge your changes.

To automatically update test snapshots, apply formatting and autofixes, add the `--fix` flag.

```bash
./rome ci --fix
```

You can alternatively run more specific commands if you need to, but they shouldn't be necessary.

### Linting

To run just the linter use:

```bash
./rome check
```

And to automatically apply formatting and autofixes:

```bash
./rome check --apply
```

### Testing

If you would like to run only the test runner:

```bash
./rome test
```

To run specific files:

```bash
./rome test path/to/files
```

And to update snapshots:

```bash
./rome test --update-snapshots
```

To enable logging:

```bash
./rome test --no-suppress-logs
```

### Generated files

If you are adding a new lint rule, or modifying some core code, you might need to regenerate some files. We have generated files to avoid having to write a lot of boilerplate and automate common tasks.

```bash
./script generate-all-files
```

Or if using Windows:

```
.\script generate-all-files
```

It's strongly advised to **run this command before commit new changes**.

## Commit messages

Internally, the Rome team adheres as closely as possible to the [conventional commit specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/).
Following this convention encourages commit best-practices and facilitates commit-powered features like change log generation.

The following commit prefixes are supported:

- `feat:`, a new feature
- `fix:`, a bugfix
- `docs:`, a documentation update
- `test`, a test update
- `chore:`, project housekeeping
- `perf:`, project performance
- `refactor:`, refactor of the code without change in functionality

Below are examples of well-formatted commits:

```
feat(compiler): implement parsing for new type of files
fix: fix nasty unhandled error
docs: fix link to website page
test(lint): add more cases to handle invalid rules
```

### Creating pull requests

When creating a new pull request, it's preferable to use a conventional commit-formatted title, as this title will be used as the default commit message on the squashed commit after merging.

## Scripts

Here are some other scripts that you might find useful.

### `lint-create-rule`

This is used to generate new lint rules and boilerplate.

```bash
./script lint-create-rule [category]/[ruleName]
```

The `category` is one of the lint category folders defined in [`internal/compiler/lint/rules`](https://github.com/rome/tools/tree/main/internal/compiler/lint/rules). Some of these represent specific languages, or general themes.

For example, to create a rule in the `js` category called `useCamelCase` run:

```bash
./script lint-create-rule js/useCamelCase
```

The created files will be listed in the console output. See those files for inline comments on what to insert. Use other lint rules as a reference.

#### Naming patterns

1. Forbid a concept

	```
	no<Concept>
	```

	When a rule's sole intention is to **forbid a single concept** - such as disallowing the use of `debugger` statements - the rule should be named using the `no` prefix. For example, the rule to disallow the use of `debugger` statements is named `noDebugger`.

1. Mandate a concept

	```
	use<Concept>
	```

 	When a rule's sole intention is to **mandate a single concept** - such as forcing the use of camel-casing - the rule should be named using the `use` prefix. For example, the rule to mandating the use of camel-cased variable names is named `useCamelCase`.

### `ast-create-node`

This is used to generate new ast nodes and boilerplate.

```bash
./script ast-create-node [language]/[category]/[nodeType]
```

The `language` is one of the language folders defined in [`https://github.com/rome/tools/tree/main/internal/ast/`]

The `category` is one of the category folders inside the `language` folders.

```bash
./script ast-create-node js/typescript/JSArrayType
```

The created files will be displayed in the console output.

### `compiler-create-prefix`

This is used to generate a new prefix boilerplate

```bash
./script compiler-create-prefix [prefixName]
```

Prefix names with dashes are preferable.
