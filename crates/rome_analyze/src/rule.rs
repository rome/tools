/// This macro is used to declare an analyzer rule type, and implement the
/// [RuleMeta] trait for it
///
/// # Example
///
/// The macro itself expect the following syntax:
/// ```ignore
/// declare_rule! {
///     /// Documentation
///     pub(crate) ExampleRule = "ruleName"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Documentation
///
/// The doc-comment for the rule is mandatory and is used to generate the
/// documentation page for the rule on the website.
///
/// Importantly, the tool used to generate those pages also runs tests on the
/// code blocks included in the documentation written in languages supported by
/// the Rome toolchain (JavaScript, JSX, TypeScript, ...) similar to how
/// `rustdoc` generates tests from code blocks written in Rust. Because code
/// blocks in Rust doc-comments are assumed to be written in Rust by default
/// the language of the test must be explicitly specified, for instance:
///
/// ```ignore
/// declare_rule! {
///     /// Disallow the use of `var`
///     ///
///     /// ### Valid
///     ///
///     /// ```js
///     /// let a, b;
///     /// ```
///     pub(crate) NoVar = "noVar"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Additionally, it's possible to declare that a test should emit a diagnostic
/// by adding `expect_diagnostic` to the language metadata:
///
/// ```ignore
/// declare_rule! {
///     /// Disallow the use of `var`
///     ///
///     /// ### Invalid
///     ///
///     /// ```js,expect_diagnostic
///     /// var a, b;
///     /// ```
///     pub(crate) NoVar = "noVar"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This will cause the documentation generator to ensure the rule does emit
/// exactly one diagnostic for this code, and to include a snapshot for the
/// diagnostic in the resulting documentation page
