# Implement the formatter

Our formatter is node based. Meaning that each AST node knows how to format itself. In order to implement
the formatting, a node has to implement the trait `ToFormatElement`.

`rome` has an automatic code generation that creates automatically the files out of the grammar. 
By default, all implementations will format verbatim,
meaning that the formatter will print tokens and trivia as they are (`format_verbatim`).

Our formatter has its own [internal IR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation), it creates its own abstraction from an AST.

The developer won't be creating directly this IR, but they will use a series of utilities that will help
to create this IR. The whole IR is represented by the `enum` `FormatElement`. Please refer to [its internal
documentation](#build-the-documentation) to understand the meaning of each variant.


## Build the documentation

Lot of examples and documentation are inside the Rust code. In order to avoid inspecting the code and 
read it, you can build it yourself and open it inside the browser:

From the root of the project: 

```shell
cargo doc -p rome_formatter --no-deps --open
```

This will automatically build and open a browser tab to the documentation.

## Rules to follow when implementing a formatter

1. Use the `*Fields` struct to extract all the tokens/nodes
   ```rust
    impl ToFormatElement for JsExportDefaultExpressionClause {
        fn to_format_element(&self, formatter: &Formatter) -> FormatResult<FormatElement> {
            let JsExportDefaultExpressionClauseFields {
                default_token,
                expression,
                semicolon_token,
            } = self.as_fields();
        }
   }
   ```
2. When using `.as_fields()` with the destructuring, don't use the `..` feature. Prefer extracting all fields and ignore them
   using the `_`
   ```rust
   impl ToFormatElement for JsExportDefaultExpressionClause {
        fn to_format_element(&self, formatter: &Formatter) -> FormatResult<FormatElement> {
            let JsExportDefaultExpressionClauseFields {
                default_token,
                expression: _,
                semicolon_token
            } = self.as_fields();
        }
   }
   ```
   The reason why we want to promote this pattern is because we want to make explicit when a token/node is excluded;
3. Use the APIs provided by `format_element.rs` and `formatter` and `formatter_traits.rs`. 
   1. `formatter_element.rs` exposes a series of utilities to craft the formatter IR; please refer to their internal
   documentation to understand what the utilities are for;
   2. `formatter` exposes a set of functions to help to format some recurring patterns; please refer to their internal
   documentation to understand how to use them and when;
   3. `formatter_traits.rs`: with these traits, we give the ability to nodes and tokens to implements certain methods
   that are exposed based on its type. If you have a good IDE support, this feature will help you. For example:
   ```rust
      impl ToFormatElement for JsExportDefaultExpressionClause {
        fn to_format_element(&self, formatter: &Formatter) -> FormatResult<FormatElement> {
            let JsExportDefaultExpressionClauseFields {
                default_token,
                expression, // it's a mandatory node
                semicolon_token, // this is not a mandatory node
            } = self.as_fields();
            let element = expression.format(formatter)?;
            let element = expression.format_with(formatter, |element| {
                format_element![element , space_token()]        
            })?;
            let semicolon = semicolon_token.format_or(formatter, || space_token())?;
            let semicolon = semicolon_token.format_or_empty(formatter)?;
            let semicolon = semicolon_token.format_with_or_empty(formatter, |semicolon_element| {
                format_element![semicolon_element, space_token()]  
            })?;
        }
   }
   ```
   Traits are much safer and, they have an additional checks around nodes e.g. comments suppression; the golden rule
   is that when you have a **typed node at hand**, prefer the `format*` traits instead of `.to_format_element`
4. Use our [playground](https://play.rome.tools) to inspect the code that you want to format. You can inspect
the AST given by a certain snippet. This will help you to understand which nodes need to be implemented/modified
in order to correctly implement the formatter. Alternatively, you can locally run the playground by following [its
instructions](/crates/rome_playground/README.md).
5. Use the [`quick_test()`](https://github.com/rome/tools/blob/main/crates/rome_formatter/src/lib.rs#L597-L616) 
function to test you snippet straight from your IDE, without running the whole test suite. The test 
is ignored on purpose, so you won't need to worry about the CI breaking.
