	/// a) It shouldn't create a completed marker wrapping no tokens
	/// b) This results in an infinite-loop if the recovery is used inside of a while loop. For example,
	///    it's common that list parsing also recovers at the end of a statement or block. However, list elements
	///    don't start with a `;` or `}` which is why parsing, for example, an array element fails again and
	///    the array expression triggers another recovery. Handling this as an error ensures that list parsing
	///    rules break out of the loop the same way as they would at the EOF.
