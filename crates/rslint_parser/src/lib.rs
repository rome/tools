//! Extremely fast, lossless, and error tolerant JavaScript Parser.
//!
//! The parser uses an abstraction over non-whitespace tokens.
//! This allows us to losslessly or lossly parse code without requiring explicit handling of whitespace.
//! The parser yields events, not an AST, the events are resolved into untyped syntax nodes, which can then
//! be casted into a typed AST.
//!
//! The parser is able to produce a valid AST from **any** source code.
//! Erroneous productions are wrapped into `ERROR` syntax nodes, the original source code
//! is completely represented in the final syntax nodes.
//!
//! You probably do not want to use the parser struct, unless you want to parse fragments of Js source code or make your own productions.
//! Instead use functions such as [`parse_text`] and [`parse_text_lossy`] which offer abstracted versions for parsing.
//!
//! Notable features of the parser are:
//! - Extremely fast parsing and lexing through the extremely fast [`rslint_lexer`].
//! - Ability to do Lossy or Lossless parsing on demand without explicit whitespace handling.
//! - Customizable, able to parse any fragments of JS code at your discretion.
//! - Completely error tolerant, able to produce an AST from any source code.
//! - Zero cost for converting untyped nodes to a typed AST.
//! - Ability to go from AST to SyntaxNodes to SyntaxTokens to source code and back very easily with nearly zero cost.
//! - Very easy tree traversal through [`SyntaxNode`](rome_rowan::SyntaxNode).
//! - Descriptive errors with multiple labels and notes.
//! - Very cheap cloning, cloning an ast node or syntax node is the cost of adding a reference to an Rc.
//! - Cheap incremental reparsing of changed text.
//!
//! The crate further includes utilities such as:
//! - ANSI syntax highlighting of nodes (through [`util`]) or text through [`rslint_lexer`].
//! - Rich utility functions for syntax nodes through [`SyntaxNodeExt`].
//!
//! It is inspired by the rust analyzer parser but adapted for JavaScript.
//!
//! # Syntax Nodes vs AST Nodes
//! The crate relies on a concept of untyped [`SyntaxNode`]s vs typed [`AstNode`]s.
//! Syntax nodes represent the syntax tree in an untyped way. They represent a location in an immutable
//! tree with two pointers. The syntax tree is composed of [`SyntaxNode`]s and [`SyntaxToken`]s in a nested
//! tree structure. Each node can have parents, siblings, children, descendants, etc.
//!
//! [`AstNode`]s represent a typed version of a syntax node. They have the same exact representation as syntax nodes
//! therefore a conversion between either has zero runtime cost. Every piece of data of an ast node is optional,
//! this is due to the fact that the parser is completely error tolerant.
//!
//! Each representation has its advantages:
//!
//! ### SyntaxNodes
//! - Very simple traversing of the syntax tree through functions on them.
//! - Easily able to convert to underlying text, range, or tokens.
//! - Contain all whitespace bound to the underlying production (in the case of lossless parsing).
//! - Can be easily converted into its typed representation with zero cost.
//! - Can be turned into a pretty representation with fmt debug.
//!
//! ### AST Nodes
//! - Easy access to properties of the underlying production.
//! - Zero cost conversion to a syntax node.
//!
//! In conclusion, the use of both representations means we are not constrained to acting through
//! typed nodes. Which makes traversal hard and you often have to resort to autogenerated visitor patterns.
//! AST nodes are simply a way to easily access subproperties of a syntax node.event;
