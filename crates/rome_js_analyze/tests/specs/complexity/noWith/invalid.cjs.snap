  ! Unexpected use of with statement.
  
    1 │ function f() {
  > 2 │   with (point) {
      │   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  > 3 │     r = Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y); // is r a member of point?
  > 4 │   }
      │   ^
    5 │ }
  
  i The with statement is potentially problematic because it adds members of an object to the current
    scope, making it impossible to tell what a variable inside the block actually refers to.
