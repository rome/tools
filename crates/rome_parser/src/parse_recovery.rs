    /// For example the syntax `(a, b, c) ...` in JavaScript can either be a parenthesized expression
    /// or an arrow function, depending on what kind of token `...` is. Thus, the parer's only option is
    /// to make the following assumption:
    /// "Let's assume `(a, b, c) ...`" is an arrow function expression"

    /// The parser then tries to parse `(a, b, c)` as an arrow function parameters and validates that `...`
    /// indeed is the `=>`. The parser rewinds and re-parses the syntax as a parenthesized expression
    /// if it turns out that `...` isn't the `=>` token or if any element in `(a, b, c)` isn't a valid parameter (for example `5 + 3` isn't valid).
