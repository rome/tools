check.js:1:4 lint/suspicious/noAssignInExpressions  FIXABLE  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  × The assignment should not be in an expression.
  
  > 1 │ if(a = b) {}
      │    ^^^^^

    Expressions are often considered as side-effect free.
  
  i Suggested fix: Did you mean '==='?
  
    1 │ if(a·===·b)·{}
      │       ++

  × Fixes applied to the file, but there are still diagnostics to address.

check.js format ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  i Formatter would have printed the following content:
  
    1   │ - if(a·=·b)·{}
      1 │ + if·((a·=·b))·{
      2 │ + }
      3 │ +
