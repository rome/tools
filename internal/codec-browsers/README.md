# `codec-browsers`

Used to parse browser target syntax.
Thanks to [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) for the idea and syntax.

## Usage

```ts
import {resolveBrowsers} from "@internal/codec-browsers";

// Accepts a string, a list of strings or parser options

resolveBrowsers("firefox 84"); // Returns a list of browser implmentations; => [firefox:84]

resolveBrowsers("firefox 84", "firefox 85"); // => [firefox:84, firefox:85]

resolveBrowsers({
	input: "firefox 84",
	offsetPosition: ...,
	path: ...,
	includeSourceTextInDiagnostics: ...,
	integrity: ...,
	sourceText: ...,
});
// => [firefox:84]
```

## Queries

For illustration purposes, browser implementations will be shown as `<browser>:<id>`.

### Combination

* Queries can be separated using a comma `,` or the `or` keyword.

	![or](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33844379/109436937-8001a400-7a22-11eb-9f62-4b22ebc20f21.png)

	`firefox 84, firefox 85` and `firefox 84 or firefox 85` are the same and result to `[firefox:84, firefox:85]`.


* Queries can be combined with the `and` keyword.

	![and](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33844379/109436933-79732c80-7a22-11eb-9593-8f27607b0fa7.png)

	`> 5% and firefox all` would result to all firefox versions that are used by more than 5%.


* Queries can be inverted (removed instead of added) with the `not` keyword.

	![not](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33844379/109436925-737d4b80-7a22-11eb-88b9-4d5cbcd48556.png)

	`> 5%, not chrome all` would result in all browser versions used by more than 5% but not chrome.
