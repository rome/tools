  ✖ Redundant constant reference

  ℹ You should avoid declaring constants with a string that's the same value as the variable name.
    It introduces a level of unnecessary indirection when it's only two additional characters to
    inline.

  ℹ This constant is declared here

  ℹ Safe fix

  - FOO
