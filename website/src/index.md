**Rome** is a JavaScript toolchain. It unifies functionality that has previously been completely separate tools in the JavaScript ecosystem.

Imagine tools like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), and more, as a single tool. That is Rome except we have built these tools from scratch in the same codebase.

Building upon a shared base allows us to provide a cohesive experience for processing JavaScript, displaying errors, parallelizing work, caching, and configuration.

**Rome is currently only supported as a linter.** As Rome's use as a linter stabilizes we will begin polishing the other pieces of Rome for release and usage.

Rome aims to **eventually** have the following responsibilities:

 - Bundling
 - Compiling
 - Documentation Generation
 - Formatting
 - Linting
 - Minification
 - Package Management
 - Testing
 - Type Checking

**Rome** was started by [Sebastian McKenzie](https://twitter.com/sebmck), the author of [Babel](https://babeljs.io) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). **Rome** is maintained by a [team of contributors](/contributing/team).
