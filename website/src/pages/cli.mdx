# CLI

## Commands

### `rome init`

Help you to set up Rome for a new project by guiding you through the creation of a new `rome.json` [configuration](/configuration) file.

The command fails if the project already has a `rome.json` configuration file.

### `rome version`

Print the version of the CLI and whether there's a server (daemon) connected

### `rome rage`

Print information for debugging purpose

### `rome lsp-proxy`

It starts a server for the LSP protocol, which communicates over `stdin` and `stdout`.

This command is useful to interact with the Rome server when developing editors/IDEs.

### `rome format`

Run the formatter on a set of files.

### `rome check`

Run the linter on a set of files and reports errors and warnings to the console.

### `rome ci`

Run the linter and verifies the formatting of a set of files. It reports errors to the console. If any errors are found the process exits with a code of `1`.

This command is intended to be used in CI workflows.

### `rome start`

Start the Rome [daemon](/internals/architecture#daemon) server

### `rome stop`

### `rome migrate`

## Global Options

### `--colors`

Set the formatting mode for markup: `off` prints everything as plain text,
`force` forces the formatting of markup using ANSI even if the console output
is determined to be incompatible

> Default: `force`

### `--use-server`

Connect to a running instance of the Rome daemon server

##### `--files-max-size`

The maximum allowed size for source code files in bytes.

> Default: 1024*1024 bytes (1 MB)

### `--config-path`

Tell Rome in which path to find the configuration file `rome.json`.

> **Warning**: when passing `--config-path`, the auto discovery of the `rome.json` file is disabled.

If Rome doesn't find a `rome.json`, it will abort the operation and exit with and error code.

### `--vcs-enabled`

Whether Rome should integrate itself with the VCS client.

### `--vcs-client-kind`

The kind of VCS client rome should support.

### `--vcs-use-ignore-file`

Whether Rome should use the VCS ignore file. When [true], Rome will ignore the files specified in the ignore file.

### `--vcs-root`

The folder where Rome should check for VCS files. By default, Rome will use the same
folder where `rome.json` was found.

If Rome can't fine the configuration, it will attempt to use the current working directory.
If no current working directory can't be found, Rome won't use the VCS integration.


### `--version`

Print the Rome version and exits.

### `--help`

Print the help message and exits.

### `ROME_BINARY`

Overrides the Rome binary being used. This allows you, for example, to use a system wide Rome binary.
