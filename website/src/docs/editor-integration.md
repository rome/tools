# Editor Integration

Rome implements the [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) implemented by [various editors](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/implementors/tools/).

When an editor extension is installed, it will find and start the version of Rome installed into your project. As we improve Rome any changes will automatically work with your editor!

- [VSCode](TODO)

## Others

We welcome contributions adding official extensions for other mainstream editors. See [contributing](/contributing) for more information! Documentation for the `rome lsp` command can be found [here](/docs/cli/commands/lsp).
