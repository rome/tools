With our [last update](https://rome.tools/blog/2021/09/21/rome-will-be-rewritten-in-rust), we announced a complete rewrite in Rust. As many can attest, rewriting can be a rather long, difficult process. Our team has been working extremely hard on this undertaking and has made great progress. Weâ€™ll write a more thorough post about our experience with Rust and rewriting in the future, but hereâ€™s a short summary of our efforts.

We started our Rust rewrite by forking the excellent RSLint parser. A huge thanks the entire RSLint team for their work, especially to [Riccardo D'Ambrosio](https://github.com/RDambrosio016) for helping us with this process. We chose the RSLint parser as we wanted a more modern, editor-focused architecture inspired by projects such as Roslyn, rust-analyzer, and TypeScript. The parser produces a concrete syntax tree (CST) that represents the original code completely, whitespace, comments and all. While a compiler can throw away semantically irrelevant info such as comments, an editor must preserve these bits of *trivia*.

However, this CST is not the easiest to navigate, which required an abstract syntax tree (AST) facade on top of this CST that allowed for a cleaner interface. This parsing infrastructure will be the foundation for Romeâ€™s focus on first class editor support. By representing the code in full fidelity, we can offer a code manipulation API for features like refactoring, code fixes, and many others.

Weâ€™re also very thrilled to announce the first showcase of this parser in our Rome Formatter: A blazing fast JavaScript and TypeScript formatter. Formatters are a perfect showcase of our parsing architecture, as they too need to preserve trivia. But why create a new formatter? When we began our Rust rewrite, we fell in love with rustfmt, Rustâ€™s own formatter. It formatted code instantly, unlike JavaScript formatters which could often take quite a few seconds on larger files. We wanted that same experience in JavaScript. Rome Formatter, like all our tools, will have the editor experience as the core. We plan on shipping a VSCode extension in the next few months that will allow for one-click adoption and usage.

Weâ€™ve also expanded our team, hiring four new members this past six months, bringing us to a total of eight team members. Weâ€™re really excited to welcome [Daniel](https://github.com/xunilrj), [LÃ©o-Paul](https://github.com/leops), and [Nicholas](https://github.com/NicholasLYang) onto the team.

Lastly, we shipped out swag to everybody who donated to our [fundraising campaign](https://rome.tools/funding/). Weâ€™ve received an [amazing](https://twitter.com/KrComet/status/1486556451011444737) [response](https://twitter.com/vcarl_/status/1486723806269874177)!
