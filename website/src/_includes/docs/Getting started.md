# Getting Started

To get started with Rome navigate to your projects folder and run:

```bash
rome init
```

This will create a `rome.rjson` files that serves as your configuration as well as telling Rome the boundary of your project.

> Note: [RJSON](/docs/rjson) is a superset of JSON that supports more-concise syntax and features such as comments.
