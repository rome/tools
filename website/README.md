## Installation

```
$ pnpm install
```

## Local Development

```
$ pnpm start
```

This command starts a local development server. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

If you want to work on the playground, additional artifacts are required and the following command must be used instead:

```
$ pnpm start:playground
```

## Build

```
$ pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the build directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
