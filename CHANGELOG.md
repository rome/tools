# Rome changelog

## 0.4.0

Rome has been [rewritten in Rust](https://rome.tools/blog/2021/09/21/rome-will-be-rewritten-in-rust)!

The great majority of the previous functionality won't work anymore, as we rewrote the whole software
from scratch.

Rome, for now, exposes a new formatter that has been revisited and, is way faster compared to its former version!

To install it, use the `next` tag on `npm`:

```shell
npm i rome@next
```

Or follow our [getting started](https://rome.tools/#getting-started) section for more details.
