```diff
- import "module" assert {}
+ import "module" with {}
```
- Allow decorators before `export` and `export default`. [#4252](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4252)

### VSCode
### JavaScript APIs

## 12.0.0

### CLI

##### Breaking changes

- Review how the traversal of the file system works. Now Rome won't navigate folders that are ignored.
	While this change is a bug fix, this could affect how the `ignore` entries are defined inside a project. We suggest to review them
	and make sure they still work.
- `--apply-suggested` is now called `--apply-unsafe`
- `rome check --apply` and `rome check --apply-unsafe` exits with non-zero code (error code)
if there are still diagnostics to be addressed.

##### Other changes

- `rome check` now checks import statements. This is an experimental feature that needs to be
	enabled via configuration. Import can be sorted using `rome check --apply-unsafe`
- Rome is able to auto discover the configuration file. If Rome doesn't fine a configuration in the
working directory, it will try to find one in the parent directories.
- Add a new global options called `--config-path`. It tells Rome to try and discover a `rome.json` file
in the given path.
	```shell
	rome format --config-path=../../other/path/
	rome check --config-path=../../other/path/
	```

### Configuration

#### Other changes

- Rome now uses the internal JSON parser to validate the configuration file. This means Rome won't
	exit anymore if there are issues with the `rome.json` file, instead it will apply its defaults
	to the sections that are incorrect.
- Add `javascript.organizeImports`. This is an experimental feature and users need to opt-in.

```json
{
  "organizeImports": {
    "enabled": true,
    "ignore": ["trickyFile.js"]
  }
}
```
- Add `linter.rules.all` and `linter.rules.[group].all`. These options allow to enable or disable **all**
rules, or all rules for a **given group**. `all` and `recommended` can't be both `true`.


```json
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "all": true,
      "style" : {
        "all": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The previous example will enable all rules and disable all rules that belong to the `style` group.

### Editors

##### Other changes

- Add support to display diagnostics for JSON files.
- Add support to format JSON files.
- Pull diagnostics when parsing a `rome.json` file.
- Imports sorting is not applied for files that are not supported or ignored.

### Formatter

- Add support for JSON files
- Add support for TypeScript 4.7
- Add support for TypeScript 5.0

### Linter

### Parser

- Support for TypeScript 4.7
- Support for TypeScript 5.0

### VSCode

##### Other changes
- Add a new option called `requireConfiguration`. Enabling this option will force Rome to require
a configuration file in your workspace/project. If Rome doesn't find a `rome.json` file, it won't
emit diagnostics.

## 11.0.0

### CLI

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- the argument `--no-colors` has been removed, in favor of `--color=off`

#### Other changes

- The `init` command now adds the `$schema` property to the generated `rome.json` file
  if `rome` is installed inside the `node_modules` folder. Follow [this guide](https://docs.rome.tools/configuration#schema) to add the `$schema` property
  manually in a project with an existing `rome.json` file.
- A new `--semicolons` option that configures if the formatter prints semicolons at the end of every statement (default) or at the beginning of statements when necessary to prevent ASI failures.
- Rome exits with an error code if it doesn't process any file.
- Fixed how the maximum number of diagnostics is calculated [#3869](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/3869).
  Rome now prints the total number of errors caused in the files.
- Rome now traverses symbolic links and emits warnings if it detects loops, and continues processing the next file during the directory traversal.
- You can force color output using the new global `--colors` option with the value `force`. Forcing color output can be useful if you spawn Rome as a subprocess.
  Rome is spawned as a process;

### Configuration

- Added the JSON schema `$schema` property. The schema enables auto-completion by editors and...
  auto-completion and descriptions of all fields of the configuration file.
- Added a new `files.ignore` option where users can ignore files across tools.

### Editors

- We also publish Rome to [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/).
- The extension now resolves the Rome version installed in the `node_modules` folder.
- Fixed an issue where diagnostics were not updated after a change to the configuration file (#3724)[https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/3724]
- The LSP emits a new action where the user can suppress a rule.
- The extension now allows [sort imports](https://github.com/rome/tools/blob/main/editors/vscode/README.md#imports-sorting-experimental)

### Formatter

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- Fixed incompatibility issues with Prettier [#3531](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3531)
  - [#3686](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/3686)
  - [#3732](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/3732)
  - [#3842](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/3842)
- Fixed an issue where infinite parentheses were wrongly inserted [#3735](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3735)
- Better formatting for `jestEach` templates

#### Other changes

- Added [support](https://docs.rome.tools/configuration/#javascriptformattersemicolon) for omitting semicolons.


### Linter

- Fixed false positives emitted by `noUselessFragments` [#3668](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3668)
- Fixed `noArrayIndexKey` where some cases were not detected [#3670](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3670)
- Fixed false positives emitted by `noConstAssign` [#3728](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3728)
- Fixed false positives emitted by `noShoutyConstants` [#3867](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3867)
- Fixed false positives emitted by `noUnusedVariables` [#3779](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3779)
- Fixed `noUndeclaredVariables` where some cases were not detected [#3798](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3798)
- Fixed `noUndeclaredVariables` where types were incorrectly detected [#3669](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3669)

#### Rules

The following rules have been stabilized:
- `nursery/useFlatMap` -> `complexity/useFlatMap`
- `nursery/useValidForDirection` -> `correctness/useValidForDirection`
- `nursery/noExplicitAny` -> `suspicious/noExplicitAny`
- `nursery/noConstAssign` -> `correctness/noConstAssign`

These rules are all recommended, so they will be enabled by default. You can simply remove those entries from your configuration file if you had enabled them manually from the `nursery` group.

The following rules have been renamed:
- `a11y/useBlankTarget` -> `a11y/noBlankTarget`
- `correctness/noMultipleSpacesInRegularExpressionLiterals` -> `complexity/noMultipleSpacesInRegularExpressionLiterals`
- `style/useOptionalChain` -> `complexity/useOptionalChain`
- `correctness/noUselessFragments` -> `complexity/noUselessFragments`
- `correctness/noDelete` -> `performance/noDelete`
- `correctness/useSingleCaseStatement` -> `style/useSingleCaseStatement`
- `correctness/useWhile` -> `style/useWhile`
- `correctness/noArguments` -> `style/noArguments`
- `correctness/noAsyncPromiseExecutor` -> `suspicious/noAsyncPromiseExecutor`
- `correctness/noCommentText` -> `suspicious/noCommentText`
- `correctness/noCompareNegZero` -> `suspicious/noCompareNegZero`
- `correctness/noDebugger` -> `suspicious/noDebugger`
- `correctness/noDoubleEquals` -> `suspicious/noDoubleEquals`
- `correctness/noShadowRestrictedNames` -> `suspicious/noShadowRestrictedNames`
- `correctness/noSparseArray` -> `suspicious/noSparseArray`
- `correctness/noUnsafeNegation` -> `suspicious/noUnsafeNegation`
- `correctness/useValidTypeof` -> `suspicious/useValidTypeof`
- `correctness/noArrayIndexKey` -> `suspicious/noArrayIndexKey`
- `correctness/noCatchAssign` -> `suspicious/noCatchAssign`
- `correctness/noDupeArgs` -> `suspicious/noDuplicateParameters`
- `correctness/noFunctionAssign` -> `suspicious/noFunctionAssign`
- `correctness/noImportAssign` -> `suspicious/noImportAssign`
- `correctness/noLabelVar` -> `suspicious/noLabelVar`
- `correctness/noRestrictedGlobals` -> `nursery/noRestrictedGlobals`
- `nursery/noDupeKeys` -> `nursery/noDuplicateObjectKeys`

If you were not changing the severity level of any of these rules in your configuration file, or suppressing a diagnostic emitted by those rules using suppression comments, you do not have to do anything. But if you did, Rome will now emit diagnostics for the parts of your configuration or suppression comments you need to update.

The following rules are no longer recommended:
- `style/noImplicitBoolean`
- `style/noNegationElse`
- `style/useBlockStatements`
- `style/useShorthandArrayType`
- `correctness/useSingleCaseStatement` / `style/useSingleCaseStatement`
- `style/noShoutyConstants`

The styling decisions imposed by these rules were not deemed to be idiomatic enough in the JavaScript ecosystem to be enabled by default. If you do want to enforce those rules in your project, you will have to enable them manually in you configuration file:

```json
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
        "style": {
            "useBlockStatements": "warn"
        }
    }
  }
}
```

Finally, the following new rules have been introduced to the nursery group in this release:
- [`nursery/noAccessKey`](https://docs.rome.tools/lint/rules/noAccessKey)
- [`nursery/noConditionalAssignment`](https://docs.rome.tools/lint/rules/noConditionalAssignment)

- [`nursery/noUnsafeFinally`](https://docs.rome.tools/lint/rules/noUnsafeFinally)
- [`nursery/noVoidTypeReturn`](https://docs.rome.tools/lint/rules/noVoidTypeReturn)
- [`nursery/useDefaultSwitchClauseLast`](https://docs.rome.tools/lint/rules/useDefaultSwitchClauseLast)
- [`nursery/useNumericLiterals`](https://docs.rome.tools/lint/rules/useNumericLiterals)
- [`nursery/useAriaPropTypes`](https://docs.rome.tools/lint/rules/useAriaPropTypes)

### Linter

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: This release changes the naming of the lint rule groups with the goal to make them language agnostic and avoid confusion among users and contributors.
were named after a language, and this caused confusion among users and contributors. Please
check our [website](https://rome.tools/docs/lint/rules/) to know better about the new groups.
The new groups are heavily inspired from [`clippy`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy#clippy)
- Added a new group called `nursery`, this group incubates new rules that are being developed.
- Added a new group called `style`, this group incubates rules that orbits around styling.
- Added a new group called `correctness`, this group incubates rules that orbits catching possible bugs.
- Fixed a code action for `useBlockStatements` [#3199](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3199)
- Improved the rule `useCamelCase` [#3190](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/3190) [#3210](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/3210)
- Fixed invalid code action for `useOptionalChain` [#3257](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3257)
- Fixed bugs in `noUnusedVariables` [#3170](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3170), [#3316](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/3316)

### Parser

- Fixed an issue where the parser was _not_ emitting a diagnostic on a certain TypeScript syntax [#3115](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3115)

### VSCode

- The setting `lspBin` can be also expressed as **relative path**
- The rules have been added to the configuration schema, allowing users to receive autocomplete
when editing the `rome.json` for the [`rules`](https://rome.tools/#linterrulescorrectness) section


## 0.9.2

### CLI

- Fixes an issue where arguments were not correctly picked up and applied to the formatter [#3175](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3175)

## 0.9.1

### CLI

- Fixes a regression where the arguments passed via CLI were ignored [#3175](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3175)
- Fixes a regression where the command `rome ci` was not correctly reading the configuration [#3167](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3167)

### VSCode

- Windows: fixes an issue where the extension could not load the configuration file [#3182](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3182)

## 0.9.0

### CLI

- You can now format content from standard input when using the command `rome format`:
```shell
echo "function f() { return {} }" | rome format --stdin-file-path example.js
```
the argument  `--stdin-file-path` is mandatory when formatting from standard in. The path should represent a
file name with its extension.
- Added `--apply-suggested` argument to the `rome check` command, to apply suggested and safe fixes.
Suggested fixes should be considered **unstable** and applied with care.
- Added the `rome start` and `rome stop` commands to control the Rome daemon server process.
- Added the `--use-server` global flag to the command line to make the CLI connect to a running instance of the
Rome daemon server.

### Configuration

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: removed the second `"rules"` field from a field group.
```diff
{
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "js": {
+        "noDebugger": "off"
-        "rules": {
-          "noDebugger": "off"
-        },
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- fixed a problem that was incorrectly turning off rules in certain circumstances

This will work from both CLI and LSP.

### Formatter

- You can now use the configuration file `rome.json` to change Rome's defaults:

  Example:
  ```json
  {
    "root": true,
    "formatter": {
      "indentStyle": "space"
    }
  }
  ```
- Fixed some edge cases where the comment suppressions were not working as expected.

### Linter

The linter is now marked as "alpha" and it can be used to lint code from the CLI and
from the LSP.


### VSCode

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Removed the majority of settings that were available in the extension, use the
configuration file `rome.json` to change the Rome's defaults.
- The extension now allows to rename variables;

## 0.7.0

### CLI

- Added `--no-colors` argument.

### Formatter

- JSX and TSX are now formatted by default! Make sure to enable Rome as default formatter in the VSCode extension.

  - call arguments;
  - object property members;
  - variable declarations;
  - object patterns;
  - class property members;
- Fixed a bunch of issues in the TypeScript formatting.

#### Improved the compatibility with Prettier (check [#2403](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/2403) for more details)

- TypeScript's formatting is better in line with what Prettier does.
- Better formatting of string literals.
Removing unnecessary quotes in string literals and quotes from member names.
Correctly choose the correct quote based on quantity of quotes inside a literal:
  ```js
  // original code
  let a = {
    "something": 3
  }
  let b = "cool isn\'t it";
  let c = "\"content\" ' ";

  // formatted code
  let a = {
    something: 3
  }
  let b = "cool isn't it";
  let c = '"content" \' ';
  ```
- Better formatting of various statements
- Improved the performance of the formatter an average of 20%-30%! Check the relevant
PRs [1](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/2456), [2](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/2638), [3](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/2612), [4](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/2462), [5](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/2634) if you're interested in what the team did.

To reach better compatibility with Prettier, the team had to revise the foundation of our printer,
which caused some regressions around how comments are printed. These are known issues that we
plan to close by next release.

### Linter

We've built the foundation of our linter. At the moment is only opt-in, and it contains
only a bunch of rules. **Safe fixes are not enabled yet via CLI**.

Refer to the [website](https://rome.tools/#linter) to learn how to start using it.

## 0.5.0

- BREAKING CHANGES: the `format` command doesn't write on disk by default. Now the command prints on terminal.

    **Migration**: add the `--write` argument when calling `rome format`

    ```shell
    rome format --write
    ```

- Added a new option called `--quote-style` to the formatter. This option is also available on VSCode.

## 0.4.0

Rome has been [rewritten in Rust](https://rome.tools/blog/2021/09/21/rome-will-be-rewritten-in-rust)!

The great majority of the previous functionality won't work anymore, as we rewrote the whole software
from scratch.

Rome, for now, exposes a new formatter that has been revisited and, is way faster compared to its former version!

To install it, use the `next` tag on `npm`:

```shell
npm i rome@next
```

Or follow our [getting started](https://rome.tools/#getting-started) section for more details.
