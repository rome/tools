# Rome changelog

### 0.10.0

### Core

- Rome is now faster and uses less memory on macOS and Linux systems! [#3237](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/3237)
- We completely revamped our diagnostics! These new diagnostics - the old diagnostics - allows
use to give better information around the errors generated by Rome.
- Greatly increased the performance of our daemon, up to 300%! [#3151](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/3151)

### Configuration

You can now ignore folders and files using the Unix shell style patterns:

```json
{
  "formatter": {
    "ignore": ["scripts/*.js"]
  },
  "linter": {
    "ignore": ["src/**.test.{ts,js}"]
  }
}
```

### Formatter

- Completely revamped how the formatter handles comments and their placement inside the code [#3277](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/3227)
- Better formatting for TypeScript intersection and unions [#3162](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3162)
- Refactored the internal representation of the formatter IR, improving performance between 3-20% [#3160](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/3160)


### Linter 

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: we completely changed how our groups are named. Some of the previous groups
were named after a language, and this caused confusion among users and contributors. Please
check our [website](https://rome.tools/docs/lint/rules/) to know better about the new groups.
The new groups are heavily inspired from [`clippy`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy#clippy)
- Added a new group called `nursery`, this group incubates new rules that are being developed.
- Added a new group called `style`, this group incubates rules that orbits around styling.
- Added a new group called `correctness`, this group incubates rules that orbits catching possible bugs.
- Added a new rule, called [`useButtonType`](https://rome.tools/docs/lint/rules/useButtonType/)
- Added a new rule, called [`noRenderReturnValue`](https://rome.tools/docs/lint/rules/noRenderReturnValue/)
- Added a new rule, called [`noDangerouslySetInnerHtml`](https://rome.tools/docs/lint/rules/noDangerouslySetInnerHtml/)
- Added a new rule, called [`useOptionalChain`](https://rome.tools/docs/lint/rules/useOptionalChain/)
- Added a new rule, called [`useFragmentSyntax`](https://rome.tools/docs/lint/rules/useFragmentSyntax/)
- Added a new rule, called [`useFragmentSyntax`](https://rome.tools/docs/lint/rules/useFragmentSyntax/)
- Fixed a code action for `useBlockStatements` [#3199](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3199)
- Improved the rule `useCamelCase` [#3190](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/3190) [#3210](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/3210)

### Parser

- Fixed an issue where the parser was emitting a diagnostic on a certain TypeScript syntax [#3115](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3115)

### VSCode

- The setting `lspBin` can be also expressed as **relative path**
- The rules have been added to the configuration schema, allowing users to receive autocomplete
when editing the `rome.json` for the [`rules`](https://rome.tools/#linterrulescorrectness) section


## 0.9.2

### CLI 

- Fixes an issue where arguments were not correctly picked up and applied to the formatter [#3175](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3175)

## 0.9.1

### CLI
 
- Fixes a regression where the arguments passed via CLI were ignored [#3175](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3175)
- Fixes a regression where the command `rome ci` was not correctly reading the configuration [#3167](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3167)

### VSCode

- Windows: fixes an issue where the extension could not load the configuration file [#3182](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3182)

## 0.9.0

### CLI

- You can now format content from standard input when using the command `rome format`:
```shell
echo "function f() { return {} }" | rome format --stdin-file-path example.js
```
the argument  `--stdin-file-path` is mandatory when formatting from standard in. The path should represent a
file name with its extension.
- Added `--apply-suggested` argument to the `rome check` command, to apply suggested and safe fixes.
Suggested fixes should be considered **unstable** and applied with care. 
- Added the `rome start` and `rome stop` commands to control the Rome daemon server process. 
- Added the `--use-server` global flag to the command line to make the CLI connect to a running instance of the
Rome daemon server. 

### Configuration

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: removed the second `"rules"` field from a field group.
```diff
{
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "js": {
+        "noDebugger": "off"
-        "rules": {
-          "noDebugger": "off"
-        },
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- fixed a problem that was incorrectly turning off rules in certain circumstances

### Configuration

- You can create a configuration file called `rome.json` to customize Rome's default options.
This will work from both CLI and LSP.

### Formatter

  Example:
  ```json
  {
    "root": true,
    "formatter": {
      "indentStyle": "space"
    }
  }
  ```
- Fixed some edge cases where the comment suppressions were not working as expected.

### Linter

The linter is now marked as "alpha" and it can be used to lint code from the CLI and
from the LSP.


### VSCode

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Removed the majority of settings that were available in the extension, use the
configuration file `rome.json` to change the Rome's defaults.
- The extension now allows to rename variables;

## 0.7.0

### CLI

- Added `--no-colors` argument.

### Formatter

- JSX and TSX are now formatted by default! Make sure to enable Rome as default formatter in the VSCode extension.
- Improved the consistency of formatting of various statements:
  - call arguments;
  - object property members;
  - variable declarations;
  - object patterns;
  - class property members;
- Fixed a bunch of issues in the TypeScript formatting.

### Linter

- Added the new `--apply` argument to the `rome check` command;
- New rules added to the linter, check the [website](https://rome.tools/docs/lint/rules/);

## 0.6.1

## 0.6.0

### Formatter

- BREAKING CHANGES: the command `rome format --ci` has been removed, use `rome ci` instead.

#### Improved the compatibility with Prettier (check [#2403](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/2403) for more details)

- TypeScript's formatting is better in line with what Prettier does.
- Better formatting of string literals.
Removing unnecessary quotes in string literals and quotes from member names.
Correctly choose the correct quote based on quantity of quotes inside a literal:
  ```js
  // original code
  let a = {
    "something": 3
  }
  let b = "cool isn\'t it";
  let c = "\"content\" ' ";

  // formatted code
  let a = {
    something: 3
  }
  let b = "cool isn't it";
  let c = '"content" \' ';
  ```
- Better formatting of various statements
- Improved the performance of the formatter an average of 20%-30%! Check the relevant
PRs [1](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/2456), [2](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/2638), [3](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/2612), [4](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/2462), [5](https://github.com/rome/tools/pull/2634) if you're interested in what the team did.

To reach better compatibility with Prettier, the team had to revise the foundation of our printer,
which caused some regressions around how comments are printed. These are known issues that we
plan to close by next release.

### Linter

We've built the foundation of our linter. At the moment is only opt-in, and it contains
only a bunch of rules. **Safe fixes are not enabled yet via CLI**.

Refer to the [website](https://rome.tools/#linter) to learn how to start using it.

## 0.5.0

- BREAKING CHANGES: the `format` command doesn't write on disk by default. Now the command prints on terminal.

    **Migration**: add the `--write` argument when calling `rome format`

    ```shell
    rome format --write
    ```

- Added a new option called `--quote-style` to the formatter. This option is also available on VSCode.

## 0.4.0

Rome has been [rewritten in Rust](https://rome.tools/blog/2021/09/21/rome-will-be-rewritten-in-rust)!

The great majority of the previous functionality won't work anymore, as we rewrote the whole software
from scratch.

Rome, for now, exposes a new formatter that has been revisited and, is way faster compared to its former version!

To install it, use the `next` tag on `npm`:

```shell
npm i rome@next
```

Or follow our [getting started](https://rome.tools/#getting-started) section for more details.
